# Visualizing-dynamical-attraction-zones-under-gravitational-potentials-using-numerical-integration
Simulation and visualization of gravitational basins of attraction using Runge-Kutta and symplectic integrators. Particles evolve in a 2D field of attractive poles, revealing dynamic capture zones through color-coded maps.
